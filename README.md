[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/87401b88cabc4226bb7154a90b203671)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/sinopeSA/StepIn-VotingSystem?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=sinopeSA/StepIn-VotingSystem&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

A command line based voting system that can be used for various purpose and at various Educational Institutes<br/>

    Voting System Application  helps in casting and calculating the votes. This application has 2 different section.
    
        1. Student Section (Panel)
        2. Admin Section (Panel)
        3. Exit( system Exit)
   
    Evolving from pen-paper based election to Digital casting of election has made it easy to keep the track on the number of votes, counting and recognising the duplicate votes or illegal votes.
    The Voting system can be used for varoius purpose.
    Here the system designed is only for Educational institute election level.



## Research:
- Manual Pen Paper voting is time consuming process
- Manual counting usally takes alot of time and resourses
- Understanding the difficultly of illegal votes is tough.
- Electronic based voting helps in saving the resoures and is eco friendly
- Electronic based voting is fast and easy.

## Defining of the Application:
- The Proposed system ensures the complete freedom to users,<br> this allows to tract the illegal votes and get detailed information about  each candidates and there votes.<br>
-  This system ensures that only registered students are allowed to vote.
    
## objective:
  The main objective of this Project is:
  1. To Allow the user to cast there own vote.
  2. To Create Election and execute the election.
  3. To Allow the application to decide the winner.  

##  Future Work:
1. The system must keep track of Banned candidates.
2. The system must keep track of Banned students(voters).
3. The system must check illegal Votes and must allow the admin to remove them.
4. The System must Check for voted voter and must not allow them to vote again.
5. The system must be flexible for all the departments
